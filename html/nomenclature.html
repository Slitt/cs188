							HOW DOES SPECIES NAMING WORK?
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Binomial nomenclature is a formal naming system by which a species is assigned a unique name composd of two Latin parts called a <b>binomial name</b> (or just "binomial"). The first part identifies the species' <b>genus</b> (which must be capitalized) and the second part identifies the species' <b>specific epithet</b>.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							As humans, our species' binomial name is <i>Homo sapiens</i> (Latin: <i>Homo</i> "man", <i>sapiens</i> "wise"), <i>Homo</i> being the genus and <i>sapiens</i> being the epithet. In print, the whole binomial must be italicized ("<i>Homo sapiens</i>") and underlined in writing ("<u>Homo sapiens</u>"). Our full taxonomy can be seen in the graphic to the left.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							In short, <b>taxonomy</b> (Greek: <i>taxis</i> "arrangement", <i>-nomia</i> "method") is the science of classifying and naming organisms based on shared characteristics. Each of these groups is called a <b>taxa</b>, represented by a single row in the graphic. If two or more species share the same taxa, then they are related in some manner with species sharing a higher taxa having more in common with each other than ones that share a lower taxa.

							ABOUT THIS SITE
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							I made the homepage by embedding &lt;a&gt;'s inside of &lt;span&gt;'s to provide hyperlink functionality. When hovering a box, its luminosity increases slightly and its text shows the order name. The lighting change was done simply in the page's <b>index.css</b> file via the <b>:hover</b> selector, replacing the original background with a slightly brighter version of itself. 
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							The text change on the homepage had to be done using Javascript by invoking a <b>show(var order)</b> and <b>hide(var order)</b> function when the cursor hovers over and leaves the &lt;span&gt; respectively. Additionally, the user must interact with a &lt;select&gt; when visiting an order's page in order to explore a family. This functionality was accomplished by invoking a <b>show(var family)</b> whenever a &lt;option&gt; is clicked, the function being given the name of the family.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							The website's appearance and functionality is so simple I could write its entirety by scratch. Therefore, I did not use any external resources other than images from third-party websites.
